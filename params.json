{"name":"Ts7260-openwrt","tagline":"Configuration files to build an openwrt image for ts7260","body":"basic information\r\n=================\r\nThis repository contains my configuration for a ts7260 root filesystem.\r\nIt's my goal to build a openwrt image with this configuration file which\r\nshould work with the kernel based on the linux 2.6 kernel from ynezz\r\n\r\ninstallation\r\n============\r\nBasicly, these are the steps I took:\r\n\r\n1. `svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/ openwrt` which was the command \r\n   I found on https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource. I used the trunk version \r\n   because the current 10.03.1 has no ep93xx support.\r\n\r\n1. Create an env directory and initiate the git repository.  This can also be\r\n   done by running `scripts/env list`\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository into your env directory.\r\n\r\nRunning make should create the same image as I am. :-)\r\n\r\ncompiling kernel\r\n================\r\nAs far as I know I just checked out the tree from ynezz and build it by\r\ncreating the configuration file on the normal way: \r\n`make ARCH=arm ts72xx_defconfig`.  I had to enable the console to see\r\nsomething on `/dev/ttyAM0`.  `CONFIG_SERIAL_8250` and \r\n`CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE` are enabled in my config.  Building the modules\r\nwas done by simply run `make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$(pwd)/../modules modules_install`\r\nwhich installed the modules in the ../modules directory.  I manually added the\r\nmodules to my image.\r\n\r\nlinks\r\n=====\r\n* The [ynezz repository](https://github.com/ynezz/linux-2.6) which gave me \r\n  the idea of building my own kernel\r\n* I've found [a mirror of openwrt on hithub](https://github.com/mirrors/openwrt)\r\n  It will probably be usefull for further development.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
