basic information
=================
This repository contains my configuration for a ts7260 root filesystem.
It's my goal to build a openwrt image with this configuration file which
should work with the kernel based on the linux 2.6 kernel from ynezz

links
=====
* The ynezz repository which gave me the idea of building my own kernel:
  https://github.com/ynezz/linux-2.6
* I've found a mirror of openwrt on hithub: https://github.com/mirrors/openwrt
  It will probably be usefull for further development.
